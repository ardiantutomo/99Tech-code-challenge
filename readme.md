# NOTES

I use Node.js to run the code.

- `npm i` to install dependency required
- `npm run problem1` to run the code for problem 1.
- `npm run problem2` to run the code for problem 2.
- for problem3, I create answer.md to explain the issues and the refactored code.
- `npm run problem4` to run the code for problem 4.
- For problem 5, I used Prisma to create the database and the models. Maybe can refer to the readme file in the src/problem5 folder for more details.
- For problem 6, I create the diagram using sequencediagram.org, and the readme file is in the src/problem6 folder.
