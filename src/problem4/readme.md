## Note

The task description is saying the function in Typescript. but in the snippets it looks like Go code. I'll go with typescript instead.
The TS file is basically the same with problem1 but i change it to typescript.

# Problem 4: Three ways to sum to n

# Task

Provide 3 unique implementations of the following function in TypeScript.
Comment on the complexity or efficiency of each function.
Input: n - any integer
Assuming this input will always produce a result lesser than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.
Output: return - summation to n, i.e. sum_to_n(5) === 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 === 15.

```go
func sum_to_n_a(n: number): number {
	// your code here
}

func sum_to_n_b(n: number): number {
	// your code here
}

func sum_to_n_c(n: number): number {
	// your code here
}
```
